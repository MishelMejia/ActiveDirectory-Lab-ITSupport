## ⚠️ Human Error — Password Policy Issue

During user creation, I encountered a password complexity error because the password did not meet domain policy requirements.

This reflects a common real-world scenario where admins must follow password standards.

## 🔐 Password Reset and Account Configuration

After correcting the password policy issue, the account was successfully configured and enabled.
