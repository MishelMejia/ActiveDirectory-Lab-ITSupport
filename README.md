# Active Directory IT Support Lab – Windows Server 2022

This repository documents my hands-on journey learning and practicing Active Directory administration using a Windows Server 2022 lab environment.

Instead of only studying theory, I decided to build my own domain from scratch and simulate real IT Support tasks that happen in everyday work environments.

## 💻 Lab Environment

- Windows Server 2022 (Desktop Experience)
- Active Directory Domain Services
- VMware Workstation
- Domain: mishel.local

This lab is built as a safe space to learn, make mistakes, troubleshoot, and understand how identity and access management works behind the scenes.

## 🧠 What I'm Practicing

Throughout this project I’m focusing on skills commonly used in IT Support and system administration roles:

- Setting up a Domain Controller
- Configuring static IP and DNS
- Designing Organizational Units (OU)
- Creating and managing users
- Working with security groups and permissions
- Exploring Group Policy basics
- Troubleshooting common configuration issues

## 🎯 Why I Built This Lab

As someone transitioning into IT Support roles, I wanted more than certificates — I wanted real practice.

This lab helps me understand how enterprise environments are structured and how IT teams manage users, access, and systems in a practical way.

## 🚀 What's Next

I’ll continue expanding this environment by:

- Joining client machines to the domain
- Applying Group Policies
- Practicing automation with PowerShell
- Documenting real troubleshooting scenarios as they happen

This is an ongoing learning project, and I’m excited to keep improving it over time.
